# ReactNewsApp

Creating a News application built in React to further practice my React skills. This Application uses the Newsdata.io api as well as the GNews.io api

I evolved the functionality of this app to serve only MMA news data. It was more advantageous to minimize the scope as the full news returns were pulling from so many sources that the app scope quickly became overbloated.
