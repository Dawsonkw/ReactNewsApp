# ReactNewsApp

Creating a News application built in React to further practice my React skills. This Application uses the Newsdata.io api as well as the GNews.io api

I evolved the functionality of this app to serve only MMA news data. It was more advantageous to minimize the scope as the full news returns were pulling from so many sources that the app scope quickly became overbloated. 

This has been the most in depth React project I have worked on, it utilizes multiple API calls that are returned and rendered to the clients page. The carousel component I created using the React-Slick Library takes the first three articles returned from each API call and displays them at the top of the page, these articles dynamically update depending on the articles that are pulled from the api calls. I utilized some dynamic DOM events to allow for increased aesthetics and functionality. Using as many hooks and libraries as I did initially posed a challenge but I believe that I overcame using novel and clever ideas even though some of them took a good amount of time to work through. I sharpened my skills in regards to design principles as well while trying to follow the material design guidelines developed by Google. Overall I believe this project to be my most complete overall and feel that it has added even more tools to my repertoire.
